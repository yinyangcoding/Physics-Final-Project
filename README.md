# Encryption Demonstration

This is a basic demonstration of "encrypted" and un"encrypted" data transmission using Python sockets.

## Executing

Execute the program by running the Main.py file with Python3.

For example:
```shell
python3 Main.py
```

## Usage

**To run preset demonstration:**
Set (within Main.py):
```python3
REAL_TIME = False
```

This will then send a cleartext transmission and then a ciphered transmission

**Without preset demonstration:**
Set (within Main.py):
```python3
REAL_TIME = True
```

***Respond to the prompts as follows:***
y: cipher transmission
n: do not cipher transmission
```
Encrypt message (y/n): 
```

Enter desired message to transmit:
```
Message: 
```
